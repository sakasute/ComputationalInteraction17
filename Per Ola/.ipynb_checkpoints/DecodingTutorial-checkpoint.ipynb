    "To keep the search complexity tractable we observe that many tokens that we are propagated are highly unlikely to contain the most probable hypotheses. These tokens can be filtered out using <em>beam pruning</em>. For every observation index we store the highest accumulated probability we have generated so far for that particular observation. We then impose a condition before we propagate a token: only propagate the token if the token's accumulated probability is within a certain distance to the highest accumulated probability for the next observation. This distance is known as the <em>beam width</em> and it is a parameter that can be used to set the operating point (or trade-off) between accuracy and time when searching for a hypothesis. The narrower the beam the more greedy the search becomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the decoder generates less hypotheses as some hypotheses are eliminated in the search."

    "To understand how to model languages we need to understand what a _message_ is and how we can quantify the information in a message. A message $m$ in some message space $M$ is sent from a _sender_ to a _receiver_. Importantly, for a message $m$ to carry information $I(m)$ from the sender to the recevier the information must not already be known to the receiver. If the information is already known $I(m)=0$. $I(m)$ measures the amount of new information, or _surprisal_, there is in receiving a message. The more surprising the message is to the receiver, the more information content in the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "$I(m)$ is called _self-information_ and is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "I(m) = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{P(m)}\\right)=-\\log_2\\left(P\\left(m\\right)\\right),\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P(m)$ is the probability of the message in the message space $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above equation is better understood by considering a message as communicating an event (such as the outcome of flipping a fair coin: heads or tails). Let information about one event $m_1$ be $I(m_1)$ and another event $m_2$ be $I(m_2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, _assuming these events are independent_, the information about _both_ these events would be $I_{both} = I(m_1\\cap m_2)= I(m_1) + I(m_2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we now think about the _probabilities_ of these events we have $P(m_1)$ and $P(m_2)$ and $P_{both} = P(m_1\\cap m_2)= P(m_1) \\cdot P(m_2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, self-information of independent events _adds_ while the probabilities of the events _multiply_. This is exactly how log-probs operate, which explains the logarithm in the above equation. Since logarithms scale with a constant factor we can set this constant factor to be negative in order to ensure information is a positive quantity. The base of the logarithm determines the unit. By convention the base is usually 2 ($\\log_2)$ and thus the unit is in _bits_.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Example 1:</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a Bernoulli trial involving flipping a fair coin. The probability of either outcome is $0.5$. To communicate the specific outcome of an individual event to the sender is the equivalent of sending a message $m$ with $I(m) = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{0.5}\\right) =  \\log_2(2) = 1$ bit.\n",

The probability $P(m_a)$ of observing four heads in a row is $\\frac{1}{16}$ and $I(m_a) = -\\log_2\\left(P\\left(m_a\\right)\\right) = -\\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right) = 4$ bits. Communicating the other possible outcome, $\\bar{m_a}$, we first find the probability $P(\\bar{m_a}) = 1 - P(m_a) = 1 - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{15}{16}$. Then $I(\\bar{m_a}) = -\\log_2\\left(\\frac{15}{16}\\right) \\approx 0.093$ bits.\n",

    "Entropy is the _average_ self-information of all messages in the message space. Entropy measures disorder. An entropy of zero means there is no disorder and everything is completely predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy tells us the average bits we need to communicate a message, assuming we have found an optimal coding scheme. The difference between the average bits actually used for communication and the optimal bits truly necessary to encode all messages is a measure of _redundancy_. Natural langauges have high redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A measure related to entropy is _perplexity_, which measures how well a probability model is at prediction. Perplexity is defined as $2^H$, where $H$ is the entropy of the model.\n",

    "<h4>Example from Jurafsky and Martin 2000; _Speech and Language Processing_:</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to bet on eight horses via a middleman. How do we communicate the horse we want to bet on?. One way is to encode this message using binary representation for each horse, horse 1 becomes 001, horse 2 becomes 010, etc. If we spend the whole day betting and each horse is coded with 3 bits then on average we are sending 3 bits per race.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we do better? Assume each horse is not equally likely but instead distributed like this: horse 1: $\\frac{1}{2}$; horse 2: $\\frac{1}{4}$; horse 3: $\\frac{1}{8}$; horse 4: $\\frac{1}{16}$; and horses 5--8: $\\frac{1}{64}$. Then the entropy of the random variable $X$ that ranges over horses gives us a lower bound on the number of bits: $H(X) = -\\sum^8_{i=1}P(i)\\log_2\\left(P(i)\\right)=2$ bits. Such a code can be built by using shorter encoding for more probable horses and longer encodings for less probable horses (for example, the most likely horse can be encoded as 0 while the least likely horse can be coded as 111111. If the horses have equal probability then if we repeat the above calculation we will find that the entropy would be 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity is the weighted average number of choices a random variable has to make. Choosing between 8 equally likely horses ($H = 3$ bits) has a perplexity of $2^3 = 8$. Choosing between the biased horses above ($H = 2$ bits) has a perplexity of $2^2 = 4$.\n",

    "The basic way of training a language model is by counting instances of $n$-grams in corpora (frequency estimation). These counts have to be normalised in order to create a probabilistic model. Fundamentally, one takes the count of say a particular bigram and divide it by the sum of all the bigrams that share the first word (which is identical to the unigram count of the first word). This is a form of _parameter estimation_. In general, we estimate an $n$-gram probability by dividing the observed frequency of a particular sequence by the observed frequency of a prefix. Using such relative frequency to estimate probabilities is an example of maximum likelihood estimation (the likelihood of the training set given the model is maximised). Typically language models use log-probs.\n",
